\KNOSOS~is part of a long-term project$^*$ aimed at the study of kinetic transport of multispecies plasmas of stellarators, in collaboration with researchers from the National Fusion Laboratory at CIEMAT (Spain), the University of Oxford (United Kingdom), the Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Greifswald (Germany) and the National Institute for Fusion Science (Japan). You can learn about our work and interests, which cover topics from the theory of energy transport in optimized stellarators to the experimental validation of impurity transport modelling in real stellarators, on our website
